# Morse Code Translator

A Morse Code to English, or English to Morse Code translator. 

Created in two days as part of my software development course at _nology. This simple Javascript/ HTML translator detects the input language (either English or Morse), and translates accordingly. The translator is fully responsive and tested with Jest. 

This project was created with test-driven development methodology in mind - all tests were written prior to any script or front-end code, and then I created the translator product specifically to pass said tests. 

## Technology
